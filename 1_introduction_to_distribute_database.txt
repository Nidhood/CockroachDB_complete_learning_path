¿What is a ditribuit database?

-> A distributed database needs to have the following characteristics:

* Scalar: Have the ability to evenly distribute data across multiple distributed participants in the database.

* Consistency: This should mediate contention and deliver the same level of isolation for transactions expected in a single instance database.

* Resilience: We can reduce the time it takes to recover from a failure down to near zero and replicate data naturally without any external configuration.

* Geo-replication: This should allow for the distribution of data through a complex, widely dispersed geographic environment. Ability to control where your data resides in a globally distributed cluster.

* SQL: The database must speak SQL, the developers should be able to use de SQL dialect they are already familiar with.

* Multi-cloud: It shouldn't be tied to a specific cloud provider (run anywhere).

¿What are acid transactions?

-> Any transaction in cockroach DB guarantees acid semantics (avoid system crashes): 

* Atomicity: Atomicity requires transactions to be "all or nothing." If any part of the transaction fails, the entire transaction is aborted, and the database is left unchanged.

* Consistency: Consistency enforces rules on data. This means that any data written in a transaction will be valid according to all defined rules, including SQL constraints.

* Isolation: Insolation ensures that concurrent transactions will leave the database in the same state that it would have been in if the transactions were executed serially, one after another.

* Durability: Durability guarantees that once a transaction is committed, it will remain so even in the event of power loss, crashes, or failures.

¿What is a serializable Insolation?

-> Every transaction behaves as if it had exclusive use of the entire cluster as it performed the transaction.

¿What type of SQL speaks cockroach DB?

-> It uses the open-source PostgreSQL wire protocol, using a mature existing ecosystem.

¿What cockroach DB delivers?

* ACID transactions.

* PostgreSQL wire protocol.

* Geo-replication.

* Multi-cloud.

* Advanced admin tools.

* Optimization.

* Baked in security

¿What is hotizontal scalar?

-> Multiple services or containers.
