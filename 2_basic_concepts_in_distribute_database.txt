How does Cockroach DB store data?

-> (Keyspace) It stores all user and system data in a giant, monolithic, ordered map of key-value pairs, in which this key space is divided into what are called ranges, contiguous chunks of the key space so that a key can be found in only one range.

In what range is the data distributed?

-> Being a distributed database, it runs across multiple nodes united in a single cluster, distributing the ranges evenly among the cluster nodes.

What are cockroach DB's important functions?

-> Leaseholder Ensure readers only see committed writes.

-> Replicas join together to form a raft group.

-> Distributed consensus for writing via raft.

-> Clusters recovery to resilient state through up-replication.

-> Node declared dead after 5 minutes by default.

-> Increase replication factor by 5+ empowers cluster resiliency.
